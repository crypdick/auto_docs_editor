# Trademarks  

Follow any usage guidelines that trademark owners provide.

## Label trademarked terms

For trademark marking or attribution in documentation, follow any usage
guidelines provided by the owners of the respective marks.

## Use trademarks only as modifiers

When you use a trademarked term, always use it to modify a noun, not as a noun
by itself. Don't use a trademark as a verb.

Never form a possessive or a plural from a trademark or change it in any way.
