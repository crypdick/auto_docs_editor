# Second and first person

* **Address the reader as *you*:** Use second person (*you/your*) for the reader. Use imperative verbs for instructions ("Click Submit").
* **Software/Users as third person:** Use third person for the software or other users ("The system processes...", "The user account is created...").
* **Organization as *we*:** Use *we* only to refer to the organization ("We recommend...", "Contact us").
* **Audience consistency:** Identify who *you* is (developer? sysadmin?) and be consistent. Do not switch expected personas mid-document.
