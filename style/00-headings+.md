# Headings and titles  

Use sentence case for headings and titles. Use descriptive headings and titles because they help
a reader navigate their browser and the page. It's easier to jump between pages and sections of a
page if the headings and titles are unique.

## Heading and title text

Write document titles based on the primary purpose of the document. If a
document is primarily a tutorial, but it has a conceptual introduction, write a
task-based title. Write section headings based on the type of content that's in
the section.

| Guidance | Recommended | Not recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| For a task-based heading, start with a [*bare infinitive*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitive#English), also known as a *plain form* or [*base form*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/English_verbs#Base_form) verb. In English, the *imperative mood* also uses the base form verb, so it looks the same as the bare infinitive.  Task-based headings are frequently used in quickstarts, how-to documents, and tutorials. | Create an instance | Creating an instance |
| For a conceptual or non-task-based heading, use a [*noun phrase*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase) that doesn't start with an *-ing* verb.  Noun-phrase headings are frequently used in concept documentation. | Migration to Google Cloud | Migrating to Google Cloud |

Use a unique level-1 heading (`h1`) for each page in a set of documents and only use
a level-1 heading once on a page.

It's OK to use task-based and conceptual heading styles in the same document.
If a single document includes both task-based and conceptual sections, then use
the appropriate phrasing for each section's heading.

When possible, avoid using *-ing* verb forms as the first word in any heading or
title.

An *-ing* verb form is a present participle or gerund. These verb forms
are inconsistently translated when they're used as the first word in a title,
and they increase character count in limited spaces.

Sometimes, there might not be a better alternative to using a gerund, such as the following
examples:

* Billing
* Pricing

It's OK to use a gerund in these cases.

It's OK to use an *-ing* verb form later in a heading or title, such as
*Introduction to BigQuery monitoring*.

Avoid repeating the exact page title in a heading on the page if possible.
For example, if you're documenting how to create a virtual machine and how to start a virtual
machine on the same task-based page, the page title could be *Create and start VM instances*,
with section headings *Create a VM* and *Start a VM*.

It's important to note that sometimes, dropping the *-ing* makes the heading inappropriately sound like a directive.
For example:

- *Troubleshooting errors* lets a user know that the section is a troubleshooting guide, whereas 
  *Troubleshoot errors* sounds like a directive.
- *Selecting a distributed inference strategy for a single model replica* lets a user know that section is relevant for a single model replica, whereas 
  *Select a distributed inference strategy for a single model replica* sounds like a directive. In this case, it's better to rephrase as *Strategies for single-replica deployments*.

### Example headings

The following example is a task-based document that includes a conceptual
heading and a task-based heading.

## Heading and title format

* Use sentence case for headings and titles.
* Don't include numbers in headings to indicate a sequence of sections.
* Use punctuation in headings sparingly, if at all. Punctuation can be a sign that your heading is
  too complicated. Consider rewriting.
* Only use an abbreviation of a word in a page title or heading if it's the more commonly known
  version of the word. If you do use an abbreviation in the page title or heading, the first
  instance of the word in a paragraph needs to be defined.
  You can define the abbreviation in the page title or heading, but consider if the additional
  length adds value. For SEO, use the more prominent version of the term in headings.
* In general, guidance that applies to text also applies to headingsâ€”for example,
  contractions and articles.
* Avoid using code items in headings when possible. If you must mention a code item in a heading,
  add a descriptive noun to the item in code font.
* Don't put a link in a heading because it can easily be confused as a style applied to a heading
  instead of a link.
* Use a heading hierarchy and take the following items under consideration:
  + Ensure that each page in your project includes a unique level-1 heading. In some publishing systems, a
    level-1 heading might be generated automatically based on a page title that you supply.
  + Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy. For example, put an `###` tag
    only under an `##` tag.
* Don't use empty headings or headings with no associated content.


## Refer to a group of sections

If you're introducing a group of related H3 or lower sections within a larger H2 section, use the
phrase *the following sections*. Don't refer to the group of sections using the phrases
*this section* or *these sections* because those phrases are ambiguous.
