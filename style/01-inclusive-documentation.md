# Inclusive documentation

Write documentation that is respectful and accessible to everyone.

## Avoid non-inclusive language

Avoid ableist, gendered, violent, and socially charged language. Vale automation checks for specific terms.

## Handling legacy code terms

If non-inclusive terms exist in code (e.g., a config parameter named `master`):

* **Code font:** Always use code font for the term: `master`.
* **Context:** Use the inclusive term in prose ("The primary node...").
* **Transition:** If necessary for clarity, you can reference the legacy term in parentheses on first use: "The primary node (called `master` in the configuration) manages the cluster."
* **Do not propagate:** Use the inclusive term for all subsequent mentions.

## Diversity

* Use diverse names, locations, and scenarios in examples.
* Avoid US-centric metaphors (sports, holidays).
