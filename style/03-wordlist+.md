    lawyer.

**ad hoc**

:   Use *happiness* when referring to a customer's perception of a
    site's reliability. Use *satisfaction* when referring to whether the
    site meets the customer's needs.

    measuring *customer happiness* instead of *customer
    satisfaction*. The two phrases are not equivalent.

    (a dispassionate act) and establishing an emotional response (creating
    happiness).

**hardcode (verb), hardcoded (adjective)**

**health check**
:   Use with caution. When describing an action taken for a computer system,
    only use the term *health check* if this is the term that appears in
    the interface. Be certain to remove any ambiguity regarding whether the

    [hotspot](#hotspot).

**hotspot**
:   In databases, *hotspots* occur when a small number of nearby rows are
    accessed frequently in a short period of time, causing CPU spikes and
    affecting performance. Use *hotspot* and *hotspots* as nouns.
    Don't use verb and gerund forms such as *hotspotting*, because they
    translate less consistently.
:   When you use *hotspot*, define it the first time that you use it on
    a page as you normally do with jargon.

**HTTPS**
:   Not *HTTPs*.

---

    impact*, use the word *affect*.

    keys in technical contexts.

    *key-value pair*, which refers to a pairing that specifies a value
    for a variable (as in configuration files).

:   Use instead of *keyring* (without the space) when referring to a
    grouping of Cloud KMS keys.

    include or point to a definition to clarify what you mean in the current
    context. Don't use *legacy* with any sort of pejorative
    connotation.

**limits**
:   In an API context, *limit* often refers to usage limits (number of
    queries allowed per second or per day). Where possible, specify the kind
    of limit that you mean, such as *usage limit* or *service
    limit*; the word *limit* can refer to many different kinds of
    limits, including rules about acceptable use.

**lint**
:   Write both command-line tool name and command in lowercase. Use code font
    except where inappropriate.

    *parent*, *initiator*, *driver*, *controller*,
    *manager*, *mixer*, *aggregator*, *publisher*,
    *leader*, or *active*.
:   If the command or code that you're documenting uses the literal word
    *master*, then use this word only in direct reference to the code
    item (formatted as code), make it clear
    what you're referring to, and use the new term thereafter.

**Material Design**
:   Capitalize each word in *Material Design*.

**MBps**
:   Short for *megabytes per second*. By convention, we don't use
    *MB/s*.

**Mbps**
:   Short for *megabits per second*. By convention, we don't use
    *Mb/s*.

**media type**
:   In general, use the term *media type*.
    In contexts where you need to refer to a *content type*—For example, if you mention
    the `Content-Type` HTTP header—it's okay to use *content type* instead, to avoid
    confusion. Don't use *MIME type*.

**method**
:   In programming contexts where *method* refers to a member of a class
    (as in Java), avoid also using the word generically to mean "approach" or

    If you feel that might be ambiguous to an audience familiar with the term *MIME*,
    then you can write *media (MIME) type* for clarity.

**mobile**
:   Don't use *mobile* as a standalone noun. Instead, specify
    *mobile phone*, or if you're talking about more than phones, then use
    *mobile device*.

**multi-cluster**
:   Hyphenate. We generally prefer to close prefixed words, but this is an
    exception because it's an established term.

**multi-region, multi-regional**
:   You can use *multi-regional* as an adjective in the context of
    multi-regions, but consider *multi-region* as
    an attributive noun instead, such as in "The dataset is in the EU
    multi-region location." Use *multiregional* in other contexts.

**multi-service**
:   Hyphenate. We generally prefer to close prefixed words, but this is
    an exception because it's an established term.

**multi-tenancy**
:   Hyphenate. We generally prefer to close prefixed words, but this is
    an exception because it's an established term.

---

### N

**native**
:   Avoid using *native* to refer to people.
:   When referring to software products, try to use a more precise
    term—for example, use *built-in* to describe a feature that's
    part of a product.
:   The term *native* isn't necessarily clear—for example,
    *cloud-native* could mean that something was written for the cloud,
    or that it's built in to a cloud platform, or that it currently exists in
    a cloud platform.

**nonce**

    phrase, such as *a number that will be used only once*.

:   It can be acceptable to use *on-premises* as a noun when it would be
    awkward to repeatedly write out a full phrase like *an on-premises
    environment*. However, it's preferable to use the more complete phrase
    whenever possible.

**parent-child or parent/child**
:   Not *parent – child* or *parent—child*.
