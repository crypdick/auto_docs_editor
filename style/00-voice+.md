# Active voice

Use active voice. The grammatical subject should perform the action.

**Why?** Passive voice often obscures the actor, making it hard for the reader to know *who* or *what* is responsible (the user? the system? a background process?).

* **Active:** "The client queries the server." (Clear: Client -> Server)
* **Passive:** "The server is queried." (Unclear: By whom?)
* **Clumsy Passive:** "The server is queried by the client." (Wordy. Just use active.)

## Exceptions (When passive is okay)

Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is unknown, irrelevant, or you want to emphasize the object.

* **Emphasis on object:** "The file is saved." (The saving is more important than who clicked the button).
* **De-emphasizing the subject:** "Over 50 conflicts were found." (Better than "You created over 50 conflicts").
* **Unknown actor:** "The database was purged." (It doesn't matter which specific process did it).
