# Active voice

Use active voice. Make clear who is performing the action.

Passive voice obscures the actor and makes sentences harder to understand (e.g., "The server is queried" vs "The client queries the server").

**Exceptions (passive voice allowed):**

* **To emphasize the object:** "The file is saved."
* **To de-emphasize the subject:** "Over 50 conflicts were found."
* **When the actor is unknown or irrelevant:** "The database was purged."
