# Contractions

* **Recommended:** Use common contractions (*you're*, *don't*, *it's*) for a conversational tone.
  * **Negation:** Prefer *don't*, *isn't*, *can't* over *do not*, *is not* (easier to scan).
* **Avoid:** Nonstandard (*guides're*), ambiguous (*'s* for *is*/possessive), or three-word contractions (*mightn't've*).
