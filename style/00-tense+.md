# Present tense

Use present tense for statements that describe general behavior that is not associated with a particular time.

## Future tense

Use future tense (*will*) only to distinguish an action that will occur in the future, distinct from the immediate action being described.

* **Correct:** "Add the filename to the backup list. The file **will be archived** the next time the backup process runs." (The archiving happens later).
* **Incorrect:** "A message is sent that **will notify** subscribers." (If the notification is part of the sending process, use present: "that *notifies* subscribers").

**Do not use future tense for:**

* Product behavior that happens immediately or asynchronously (unless strictly a future event).
* Describing how a feature *will* work after a future update (document the current version).

## Hypotheticals

Avoid the hypothetical future *would*. It often implies uncertainty.

* **Recommended:** "If you send an unsubscribe message, the server **removes** you from the mailing list."
* **Not recommended:** "You can send an unsubscribe message. The server **would then remove** you from the mailing list."
