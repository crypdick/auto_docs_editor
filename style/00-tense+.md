# Present tense

Use present tense for general behavior.

* **Recommended:** "The server sends an acknowledgment."
* **Not recommended:** "The server will send an acknowledgment."

**Future tense exceptions:**

* Use *will* only for actions that occur in the future (e.g., "The file will be archived the next time backup runs").
* Do not use *will* for product behavior that happens immediately or asynchronously (unless strictly future).

**Hypotheticals:**

* Avoid hypothetical *would*.
* **Recommended:** "If you send a message, the server removes you."
* **Not recommended:** "The server would then remove you."
