# Prescriptive documentation

Write prescriptive (opinionated) documentation that tells the reader what to do rather than just listing options.

## Word choice
*   **Required actions:** Use *must* or imperative mood ("Do X").
*   **Recommended actions:** Use "We recommend..." or "Google recommends...".
*   **Optional actions:** Use *can*.
*   **Possibilities:** Use *might* or *can*.
*   **Outcomes:** Describe what happens ("The process returns 10 items").
*   **Actual state:** When describing the state of something (e.g., a variable), avoid "should" which implies obligation. Use *is*, *sets*, or *must set*.
    *   *Correct:* "The server sets the value to true."
    *   *Incorrect:* "The value should be true."

**Avoid "should":** It creates ambiguity (is it required or just a good idea?).

**Examples:**
*   **Recommended:** "You must set the value to true." / "You can use approach B."
*   **Not recommended:** "The value should be true."
