# Cross-references and linking  

In general, cross-references link to nonessential information that adds to
the reader's understanding.

When used well, cross-references help readers navigate and understand
documentation. But cross-references can easily become disruptive. The guidelines
on this page help you to minimize disruption while providing cross-references
that help your readers.

## Choose links selectively

Be selective about which links you include on a page. Each link creates a
decision for the reader, adding cognitive load. Each link is also a chance for
the reader to leave the page and lose their place. When you include links,
choose the most relevant destination.

### Provide context on the page

When possible, provide help in context rather than linking elsewhere. For
example, in the following situations, consider providing information on the
page instead of linking:

* Define a term.
* Briefly explain a concept.
* Provide a couple of steps.

As a specific example, if you need readers to understand another product's
software or standards, it's better to link to good documentation elsewhere
than to try to thoroughly document another product's standards in our
documentation. But if a few sentences of basic information is all your readers
need, then it's better to provide that context and save your readers the trip
outside of our documentation.

### Avoid duplicate links

Generally, within a given page, don't provide duplicate links to the same
destination. Provide the link once in the location where it's most useful to
the reader.

It's OK to add a secondary link in situations such as the following:

* You're linking to a particular section of another page.
* Your page is very long and the duplicate links are far apart.
* There are multiple entry points to the document that you're linking from.
  For example, if a page contains a procedure section and a troubleshooting
  section, then you might need to provide the same link in both of those
  sections.

### Provide the most relevant link

When you link, link to the most relevant page on a site. Link to the most
relevant heading on a page. Avoid providing multiple links that do the same
job.

### Link to third-party sites

Our documentation often relies on the reader knowing something about
third-party standards or software. In such cases, it's better to provide a
link rather than attempt to thoroughly document someone else's standards. But
as with all links, when possible, provide brief information on the page
instead of linking.

## Write descriptive link text

For the link text itself, use short, unique, descriptive phrases that provide
context for the material that you're linking to.

Effective link text helps to improve accessibility and scannability. Different
readers experience links differently. For example, users of screen reader
software often jump from one link to the next without reading the words in
between. Other readers visually scan a document to find relevant links.

Sometimes you have to rework a sentence to include a phrase that makes good
link text.

### Two options for effective link text

For your link text, use either the exact page title or a descriptive phrase, as
described in the following sections.

#### Page titles as link text

One option for effective link text is to match the link text to the page
title or heading that you're referencing.

[Load balancing and scaling](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling).

#### Descriptive phrases as link text

Another option for effective link text is to use a description of the
destination page, capitalized as if it's part of the sentence.

When you write a descriptive phrase as link text, help readers quickly
determine whether the link is relevant to them:

* Place important words at the beginning of the link text.
* Don't use the same link text in the same document for different target
  pages.
* Keep link text short where possible.
  Don't write lengthy link text such as a sentence or short paragraph.

### Avoid vague link text

Write link text that makes sense without the surrounding text.
Don't use phrases such as *this document*, *this article*, or *click here*.

### Avoid URLs as link text

In general, don't use a URL as link text. Instead, use the page title or a
description of the page.

```

**Exception**: In some legal documents (such as some Terms of Service documents), it's
okay to use URLs as link text.

### Include abbreviations in link text

If the text includes an abbreviation in parentheses, include the long form
and the abbreviation in the link text.

### Link to commands

If the text includes a command or another element usually conveyed with
code font, include the description of the code element with the link text,
unless doing so is awkward or redundant.

## Write link introductions ("For more information")

When you dedicate a separate sentence to a cross-reference, introduce the
cross-reference using consistent languageâ€”specifically, use the phrase "For more
information, see..." or "For more information about..., see... ."

Include the "about..." clause when the link text or surrounding context
doesn't clearly indicate why you're referring the reader to this information.

Don't use *on* instead of *about*.

Use *see* to refer to links and cross-references.

## Clarify the purpose of a link

Make sure that the surrounding context or the link text itself clearly
indicates why you're referring the reader to this information. Make the
explanation specific, but don't repeat the link text.

If you're introducing a cross-reference with "For more information..."
phrasing, then you can do this by adding an "about..." phrase.

## Explain unexpected link behavior

If a link goes to an unexpected destination or behaves in an unexpected way,
then provide that context. The following are a few such situations:

* **Links that download files and open emails.** If a link
  downloads a file or opens an email, then make that clear in the link text, and
  mention the file type.

  Recommended:

  ```

  ```
* **Links to sections on the same page.** When you're
  linking to another section on the same page, let the reader know that the link
  takes you to a different section of the same page. Use a standard phrase to clue
  readers in if you use an on-page link.

  information, see the
  [Write descriptive link text](#descriptive-link-text)
  section of this document.

  * **Links to sections on another page.** When you're linking
    to a section heading on another page, use the same wording and formatting as you
    do in a regular cross-reference.

    If the title of the section that you're linking to is identical to a
    title on the source page, add context to the cross-reference.

  * **Links that open in a new tab.** For more information, see the
    [Open links in the current tab](#current-tab) section of this
    document.

## Punctuation around link text

If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the
punctuation outside of the link tags where possible.

## Quotation marks and italics

When a cross-reference is a link, don't put the link text in quotation marks.

## Avoid external links in your documentation navigation

In a documentation set's navigation, such as a table of contents, we
recommend against linking outside of the documentation set. Instead, include the
link in a page within the documentation.

If you need to link outside of your documentation set from your navigation,
then make sure it's clear to the reader that they'll be leaving that document
set.
