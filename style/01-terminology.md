# Terminology and naming

## Jargon

Avoid jargon (specialized or figurative terminology) unless it is standard in the industry or necessary for SEO.

### Guidelines

* **Write around it:** Use plain language.
  * *Avoid:* "Create a back-of-the-envelope design."
  * *Use:* "Create an informal design."
* **Define it:** If you must use jargon (e.g., *swim lane*, *break-glass procedure*), define it in parentheses or link to a definition on first use.
* **Code:** If jargon appears in code (e.g., `whitelist`), keep it in code font but explain it using plain, inclusive language.

## Italics for terms

Use italics in two specific cases:

1. **New terms:** Italicize a new technical term upon its first definition (e.g., "A *Clos network* is a kind of...").
2. **Words as words:** Italicize when referring to a word or letter itself (e.g., "Use the word *and*").

**Note:**

* Do not use bold or quotation marks for these cases.
* This style does **not** apply to code elements (use code font) or product names (use standard capitalization).

## Product names

* **Capitalization:** Use Title Case for official product names (*Google Cloud*). Follow official branding.
* **Lowercase names:** If a product name starts with a lowercase letter (e.g., *macOS*), avoid starting a sentence with it. Rewrite the sentence.
  * *Avoid:* "macOS is required."
  * *Use:* "You need macOS to run the app."
* **Features:** Use lowercase for generic feature names unless officially capitalized.
* **Articles:**
  * **No 'the':** Before product names (*Cloud Datastore*).
  * **Use 'the':** Before tool/API names (*The Transcoder API*, *The gcloud CLI*).
* **Verbs:** Do not use product names as verbs.

## Third-party content

Do not copy content from third-party sources to avoid copyright issues. Link to the content instead.

**Sources to avoid copying:**

* Books, blogs, articles.
* Open Source documentation (licenses vary).
* GitHub repositories (licenses vary).
