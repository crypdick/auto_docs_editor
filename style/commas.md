# Commas

*   **Serial (Oxford) Comma:** Use it in a series of 3+ items.
*   **Introductory phrases:** Place a comma after introductory phrases.
*   **Independent clauses:** Use a comma before coordinating conjunctions (*and, but, or*) that join two independent clauses.
*   **Dependent clauses:** Generally no comma if the dependent clause follows the independent one.
*   **Nonrestrictive clauses:** Use commas (e.g., "The group, *which is large*, ...").
*   **Conjunctive adverbs:** Comma after *however*, *therefore*, etc.
