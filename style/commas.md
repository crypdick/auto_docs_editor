# Commas

* **Serial (Oxford) Comma:** Use it in a series of 3+ items ("zones, regions, and multi-regions").
* **Introductory phrases:** Place a comma after introductory phrases ("Finally, ...").
* **Independent clauses:**
  * Use a comma before coordinating conjunctions (*and, but, or*) that join two independent clauses ("The library creates feeds, and it ensures validity").
  * *Exception:* You can omit the comma if both clauses are very short.
* **Dependent clauses:**
  * Generally **no comma** if the dependent clause follows the independent one ("Flags are variables and can be read directly").
  * Use a comma *only* if the sentence is confusing without it.
* **Nonrestrictive clauses:** Use commas to set off clauses that add extra info ("The group, *which is large*, ...").
* **Conjunctive adverbs:** Comma after *however*, *therefore*, etc.
