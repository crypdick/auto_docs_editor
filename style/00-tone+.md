# Voice and tone

**Voice:** Conversational, friendly, respectful, and knowledgeable. Aim to sound like a helpful colleague.
**Tone:** Casual but professional. Accessible to a global audience.

## Guidelines

* **Be conversational but not colloquial:** Use natural language, but avoid slang ("dude", "awesome") or text-speak.
* **Be direct but polite:** Use the imperative mood ("Click Save") without excessive politeness ("Please click Save").
  * *Exception:* "Please" is acceptable in FAQs or when asking for user feedback/help.
* **Avoid fillers:** Remove phrases like "Please note," "At this time," or "It is important to note that."
* **Avoid subjectivity:** Words like "simply," "easy," "just," or "quickly" can be frustrating if the user finds the task difficult.
* **No "Let's":** Avoid "Let's do X." Use "Do X."
* **No pop-culture references:** They age poorly and may not translate across cultures.
* **Exclamation marks:** Use them rarely, if ever.

## Techniques for checking tone

* **Read it aloud:** If a sentence sounds awkward or robotic when spoken, rewrite it to be more conversational.
* **Check transitions:** Use transitions (*though*, *however*, *this way*) to make text flow smoother, but avoid overusing formal transitions like *nonetheless* or *herein*.
