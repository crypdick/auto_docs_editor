# Voice and tone

**Voice:** Conversational, friendly, respectful, and knowledgeable. Aim to sound like a helpful colleague.
**Tone:** Casual but professional. Accessible to a global audience.

## Guidelines

* **Be conversational but not colloquial:** Use natural language, but avoid slang ("dude", "awesome") or text-speak.
* **Be direct but polite:** Use the imperative mood ("Click Save") without excessive politeness ("Please click Save").
  * *Exception:* "Please" is acceptable in FAQs or when asking for user feedback/help.
* **Avoid fillers:** Remove phrases like "Please note," "At this time," or "It is important to note that."
* **No "Let's":** Avoid "Let's do X." Use "Do X."
* **No pop-culture references:** They age poorly and may not translate across cultures.

## Techniques for checking tone

* **Read it aloud:** If a sentence sounds awkward or robotic when spoken, rewrite it to be more conversational.
* **Check transitions:** Use transitions (*though*, *however*, *this way*) to make text flow smoother, but avoid overusing formal transitions like *nonetheless* or *herein*.

## Anthropomorphism

Don't attribute human qualities (seeing, telling, thinking, wanting) to software or hardware.

**Why?** Anthropomorphism is figurative language, which is imprecise and difficult to translate.

* **Recommended:** "The system detects a new device." / "The object specifies the split point."
* **Not recommended:** "The system sees a new device." / "The object tells the splitter..."

## Excessive claims

* **Avoid hype:** Don't use *best*, *fastest*, *guaranteed* unless verifiable.
* **Future-proof:** Ensure claims will remain true over time. Avoid absolute statements that might be invalidated by future releases or competitor updates.
* **Security:** Don't claim a product is "secure" (implies invulnerability). Say it "helps with security" or "is designed for security".
* **Comparisons:** Be factual, specific, and cite sources.
