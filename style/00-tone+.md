# Voice and tone

**Voice:** Conversational, friendly, respectful, and knowledgeable (like a helpful colleague).
**Tone:** Casual but professional. Avoid being overly formal ("pedantic") or overly casual ("slang/wacky").

**Avoid:**

* **Slang/Jargon:** "Dude", "awesome", "digits".
* **Filler:** "Please note", "At this time".
* **Subjective/Condescending:** "Simply", "Easy", "Just".
* **Directives:** "Let's do X" (use "Do X").
* **Politeness:** Don't use "Please" in instructions (e.g., "Click Save," not "Please click Save").
* **Metaphors:** Avoid idioms that may not translate well.

**Goal:** clear, direct communication that is accessible to a global audience.
