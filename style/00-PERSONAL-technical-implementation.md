# Don’t explain technical implementation

Whenever possible, do not document technical implementation details. Most users are not contributors.

Before documenting technical implementation details, ask yourself what information the user actually needs to know to use the product or feature effectively. 

If you find yourself using reasoning along the lines of “By understanding the technical implementation, the user will be better equipped to make informed decisions about using the feature”, stop and write bulleted lists focused on conveying recommended use cases and configurations, limitations, and caveats for the end user. In most cases, these convey all the information you hoped the user would infer from having a detailed understanding of the technical implementation.

Technical implementation details are interesting to some readers, but generally not required to use a feature. These should be published separately as engineering blogs.
