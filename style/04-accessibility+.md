# Accessible documentation

* **Readability:**
  * Break up text with headings and lists. Keep sentences short (<26 words).
  * Use parallel structure for lists.
  * Define acronyms on first use.
  * Place important info at the start of sentences.
  * Use clear, direct language (no double negatives).
  * Don't use "&" instead of "and" (unless in code/UI).
* **Headings:** Use a hierarchy (don't skip levels). Use descriptive headings.
* **Links:**
  * Use meaningful text (not "click here").
  * Explain unexpected behavior (e.g., "opens PDF").
  * Separate adjacent links with text/punctuation.
* **Tables:**
  * Introduce tables in text.
  * Use header cells (`th`) with `scope` attributes.
  * Avoid tables in procedures or for layout.
* **Images:** Always provide `alt` text.
