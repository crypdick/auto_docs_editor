# Headings and titles

Use sentence case for headings and titles.

## Heading text

* **Task-based headings:** Start with a bare imperative verb (e.g., "Create an instance" not "Creating an instance").
* **Conceptual headings:** Use noun phrases (e.g., "Migration to cloud" not "Migrating to cloud").
* **Gerunds (-ing):** Avoid starting headings with "-ing" words (gerunds) unless necessary (e.g., "Billing", "Pricing"). Gerunds can translate inconsistently and often sound like directives when the "-ing" is dropped, or increase character count.
  * *Troubleshooting errors* (gerund) indicates a guide.
  * *Troubleshoot errors* (imperative) sounds like a directive.
  * If the distinction matters, choose the form that best fits the content type (guide vs. task).
* **Unique headings:** Ensure each H1 is unique in the project, and each heading on a page is unique.
* **No repetition:** Don't repeat the page title in a heading.

## Heading format

* **Sentence case:** Always use sentence case.
* **No numbers:** Don't use numbers to indicate sequence (e.g., "1. Introduction").
* **Minimal punctuation:** Avoid punctuation in headings. Punctuation often indicates the heading is too complex and should be rewritten.
* **Hierarchy:** Don't skip levels (e.g., H2 to H4).
* **No links:** Do not put links in headings.

## Grouping sections

When introducing a group of subsections, use "The following sections describe..." instead of "This section" or "These sections".
