# Jargon

Avoid jargon (specialized or figurative terminology) unless it is standard in the industry or necessary for SEO.

## Guidelines

* **Write around it:** Use plain language.
  * *Avoid:* "Create a back-of-the-envelope design."
  * *Use:* "Create an informal design."
* **Define it:** If you must use jargon (e.g., *swim lane*, *break-glass procedure*), define it in parentheses or link to a definition on first use.
* **Code:** If jargon appears in code (e.g., `whitelist`), keep it in code font but explain it using plain, inclusive language.
