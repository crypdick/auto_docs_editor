# Jargon

Avoid jargon (specialized/figurative terminology like *swim lane*, *out-of-the-box*) unless necessary for the audience/SEO.

**Guidelines:**
*   **Write around it:** Use plain language ("informal design" instead of "back-of-the-envelope").
*   **Define it:** If you must use it, define it in parentheses or link to a definition on first use.
*   **Code:** If jargon appears in code (e.g., `whitelist`), keep it in code font but explain with plain language.
