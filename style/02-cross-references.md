# Cross-references and linking

## Strategy

* **Context first:** Provide brief definitions or steps inline instead of linking, to reduce cognitive load.
* **Selectivity:** Link only to relevant information. Avoid duplicate links on the same page.

## Link Text

* **Descriptive:** Use the destination page title or a descriptive noun phrase.
* **No "click here":** Avoid "click here", "this document", or bare URLs (except in legal docs).
* **Abbreviations:** If the text has an abbreviation, include the full term in the link text to aid search/scanning.
  * *Recommended:* "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"
* **Code items:** If linking to a command or flag, include the description in the link text if possible.
  * *Recommended:* "...run the `--hostname` flag."

## Formatting

* **Introduction:** Use "For more information, see Link Text."
* **Punctuation:** Place punctuation outside the link tags.
* **Tabs/Downloads:**
  * Open links in the same tab.
  * If a link behaves unexpectedly (e.g., downloads a PDF), mention it in the text: "Download the security features PDF."
* **Quotes/Italics:** Do not use quotes for link text. Use italics for titles of full-length works (books) that aren't linked.
