# Cross-references and linking

## Strategy
*   **Context first:** Provide brief definitions or steps inline instead of linking, to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Selectivity:** Link only to relevant information. Avoid duplicate links on the same page.

## Link Text
*   **Descriptive:** Use the destination page title or a descriptive noun phrase.
*   **No "click here":** Avoid "click here", "this document", or bare URLs (except in legal docs).
*   **Abbreviations:** If the text has an abbreviation, include the full term in the link text.

## Formatting
*   **Introduction:** Use "For more information, see [Link Text]."
*   **Punctuation:** Place punctuation outside the link tags.
*   **Tabs:** Open links in the same tab (unless it's a file download like PDF).
*   **Quotes/Italics:** Do not use quotes for link text. Use italics for titles of full-length works (books) that aren't linked.
