# Pronouns

Ensure pronouns clearly refer to their antecedent.

## Ambiguous references

* **Clarify 'it/this/that':** Follow demonstrative pronouns with a noun.
  * **Recommended:** "Set *this value* to true."
  * **Not recommended:** "Set *this* to true."
* **Vague antecedents:** Rewrite if the pronoun's target is unclear.

## Gender-neutral pronouns

* Use singular *they* instead of *he*, *she*, or *he/she*.

## Personal pronouns

* **Second person:** Use *you* whenever possible.
* **First person:** Avoid *I*, *we*, *us* except in FAQs or when referring to the organization (e.g., "We recommend...").

## Relative pronouns

* **That vs. Which:**
  * Use *that* for restrictive clauses (no comma): "The echidna *that has a long snout* is furry." (Specifies which one).
  * Use *which* for non-restrictive clauses (comma): "The echidna, *which has a long snout*, is furry." (Adds extra info).
* **Who:** Use *who* for people.
* **Optional pronouns:** Use *that* and *which* to prevent ambiguity (e.g., "The link *that* you want to open").
