# Periods and other end punctuation  

End a complete sentence with a period, unless it's a question. There are
exceptions for working in lists.

## Periods with lists

Whether to end a list item with a period depends on several factors, including
the kind of list that the item appears in.

## Periods with URLs

When a period immediately follows a URL or a file path, it can be hard to
tell whether the period is part of the URL.

To indicate that the punctuating period isn't part of the URL, try one of the
following techniques:

* Whenever possible, avoid putting URLs in text.
* Rewrite the sentence so that the URL isn't at the end of the sentence.
* Put the URL on a separate line from the text, omitting the final period.

If the URL is a link, it generally looks different from the surrounding text. For
example, in most browsers, link text is blue by default. This formatting helps
distinguish the URL from the period.

When you do put a period after a URL, don't leave any space between the last character of
the URL and the period.

## Periods with quotation marks

When a sentence ends with material inside quotation marks, place the period
inside the quotation marks even if the period isn't part of the material inside
the quotation marks. An exception to this guideline applies if you're using quotation marks around
a keyword or other literal string.

Recommended: ... you might say "Fixed typo."

If the material inside the quotation marks ends with a question mark or an
exclamation point, don't use a period.

Recommended: Children always ask "Why?"

## Periods with parentheses

If the last part of a sentence is contained inside parentheses, put the
period after the closing parenthesis.

If the parentheses contain a complete sentence, put the period inside
the parentheses.

Recommended: Your application could show
a notification when a relevant file or folder has changed (even if that change
occurs while your application isn't running).

Recommended: App Engine applications are
easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale. (With App Engine, there are
no servers for you to maintain.)

## Periods with headings

Don't end headings with periods.

## Periods with numbers

Use a period to represent a decimal point. (Using a comma to separate the decimal part
of a number is the editorial custom in some countries, but not in the US.)

## Periods with abbreviations

Put a period after a shortened word.

Don't put periods after the letters of an acronym or initialism.

## Spaces between sentences

Leave only one space between sentences.

## Exclamation points

Don't use exclamation points in text except when they're part of a code
example.
