# Code samples  

This page explains how to format code samples.

## Basic guidelines

Follow these guidelines when formatting code samples:

* **Wrap lines** at 80 characters.

  If you expect readers to have a relatively narrow browser window or to print out your
  document, consider wrapping at a smaller number of characters for readability.
* **Indicate omitted code by using a comment** in the syntax of the language of your code
  sample. Don't use three dots or the ellipsis character (`â€¦`). If a code
  block contains an omission, don't format the block as click-to-copy.
* If a multiline code block is surrounded by a triple backtick code-fence, do not remove the code-fence. If it is missing the code-fence, make sure to add it.
* Code inside a code-fence should be indented by 4 spaces.
* Multiline bash scripts should indent the subsequent lines by 4 spaces.

Recommended:
```bash
    python run.py --flag1 \
        --flag2 \
        --flag3
```

Not recommended:

```bash
    python run.py --flag1 --flag2 --flag3
```

Recommended:

```
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service

    spec:
      containers:
      - image: IMAGE_URL
        ports:
        - name: h2c
          containerPort: 8080
```

## Introductory statements

In most cases, precede a code sample with an introductory sentence or
paragraph. The introduction can end with a colon or a period; usually a colon if it
immediately precedes the sample, usually a period if there's more material (such
as a note paragraph) between the introduction and the sample, or if the
introduction paragraph ends in a sentence that isn't directly related to the
sample.

Recommended (ending with a period): The
