# Code samples

* **Formatting:** Wrap lines at 80 characters.
* **Omissions:** Use comments (e.g., `# Code omitted`) instead of ellipses (`...`).
* **Introductions:** Precede with an introductory sentence/paragraph.
  * End with a **colon** if the sample follows immediately.
  * End with a **period** if there is text between (e.g., a note) or if the sentence isn't a direct lead-in.
* **Markdown:** Ensure multiline code blocks are surrounded by triple backticks.
* **Copyable:** Ensure samples are valid and copyable (unless they contain omissions/placeholders that break syntax).
