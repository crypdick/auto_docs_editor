# Code samples

*   **Formatting:** Wrap lines at 80 characters.
*   **Omissions:** Use comments (e.g., `# Code omitted`) instead of ellipses (`...`).
* **Introductions:** In most cases, precede a code sample with an introductory sentence or paragraph. End the introductory sentence or paragraph with a colon if the sample follows immediately; otherwise use a period.
*   **Copyable:** Ensure samples are valid and copyable.
* If a multiline code block is surrounded by a triple backtick code-fence, do not remove the code-fence. If it is missing the code-fence, make sure to add it.
