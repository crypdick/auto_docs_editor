# Person and pronouns

## Second and first person

* **Address the reader as *you*:** Use second person (*you/your*) for the reader. Use imperative verbs for instructions ("Click Submit").
* **Software/Users as third person:** Use third person for the software or other users ("The system processes...", "The user account is created...").
* **Organization as *we*:** Use *we* only to refer to the organization ("We recommend...", "Contact us").
* **Audience consistency:** Identify who *you* is (developer? sysadmin?) and be consistent. Do not switch expected personas mid-document.

## Pronoun clarity

Ensure pronouns clearly refer to their antecedent.

### Ambiguous references

* **Clarify 'it/this/that':** Follow demonstrative pronouns with a noun.
  * **Recommended:** "Set *this value* to true."
  * **Not recommended:** "Set *this* to true."
* **Vague antecedents:** Rewrite if the pronoun's target is unclear.
  * **Ambiguous:** "If you type text in the field, it doesn't change." (Does "it" refer to the text or the field?)
  * **Clear:** "If you type text in the field, the text doesn't change."

### Gender-neutral pronouns

* Use singular *they*.

### Personal pronouns

* **Second person:** Use *you* whenever possible.
* **First person:** Avoid *I*, *we*, *us* except in FAQs or when referring to the organization (e.g., "We recommend...").

### Relative pronouns

* **That vs. Which:**
  * Use *that* for restrictive clauses (no comma): "The echidna *that has a long snout* is furry." (Specifies which one).
  * Use *which* for non-restrictive clauses (comma): "The echidna, *which has a long snout*, is furry." (Adds extra info).
* **Who:** Use *who* for people.
* **Optional pronouns:** Use *that* and *which* to prevent ambiguity (e.g., "The link *that* you want to open").
