# Grammar

## Plurals

### Single letters

Italicize the letter and add *'s* (e.g., "Mind your *p*'s and *q*'s"). When capitalization is irrelevant, use uppercase (e.g., "Mind your *P's* and *Q's*").

### Parenthetical plurals

Do not use parenthetical plurals like "value(s)". Use "one or more values" or just the plural form.

## Prepositions

* **End of sentence:** It is acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition if it sounds more natural (e.g., "...the language you're interacting with").
* **Clarity:** Use prepositions to increase clarity, but omit unnecessary ones.

## Sentence structure

* **Conditions first:** Place circumstances/conditions before instructions so readers know if it applies to them.
  * **Recommended:** "If you want to delete the file, click **Delete**."
  * **Not recommended:** "Click **Delete** if you want to delete the file."
* **Natural order:** If putting the condition first creates a convoluted sentence, rewrite it for natural flow.
  * *Awkward condition-first:* "In the environment you plan to use to build documentation, don't install Ray."
  * *Better:* "When building documentation, use a separate environment that doesn't have Ray installed."
* **Closeness:** Keep the subject and verb close together.
