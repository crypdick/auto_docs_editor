# Tables

## When to use

* **Use tables for:** Sets of data with 3+ related attributes (columns).
* **Do NOT use tables for:**
  * Layout (use CSS).
  * Code snippets.
  * Long 1-dimensional lists (use columns or a list).
  * Steps in a procedure.

## Formatting

* **Headers:** Use `th` elements with `scope="col"` or `scope="row"`. Use sentence case. Do not end headers with punctuation.
* **Cells:**
* Avoid empty cells.
* **Captions:** If using multiple tables, number them (**Table 1.** Description) and refer to them by number.

## Placement

* Introduce the table with a complete sentence that describes its purpose.
* Do not place a table in the middle of a sentence.
