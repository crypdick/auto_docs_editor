# Product names

* **Capitalization:** Use Title Case for official product names (*Google Cloud*). Follow official branding.
* **Lowercase names:** If a product name starts with a lowercase letter (e.g., *macOS*), avoid starting a sentence with it. Rewrite the sentence.
  * *Avoid:* "macOS is required."
  * *Use:* "You need macOS to run the app."
* **Features:** Use lowercase for generic feature names unless officially capitalized.
* **Articles:**
  * **No 'the':** Before product names (*Cloud Datastore*).
  * **Use 'the':** Before tool/API names (*The Transcoder API*, *The gcloud CLI*).
* **Verbs:** Do not use product names as verbs.
