# Product names  

This page describes how to use product names.

## Capitalize product names

In general, product names are in *title case*, sometimes called
*init-capped*, which means that every word is capitalized except for
prepositions like *of* or *on* and articles like *a* or
*the*. When you refer to product, use title case except
when you're matching a UI label.

When you write about any product, follow the official capitalization for the
names of brands, companies, software, products, services, features, and
terms defined by companies and open source communities.

* For example, if you're using Kubernetes-related terms, then follow
  the capitalization that's shown in the Kubernetes Concepts
  documentation.

  Recommended in a Kubernetes
  context: A Job creates one or more Pods.

  Recommended: The Cloud Scheduler
  job publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic at one-minute intervals.
* If an official name begins with a lowercase letter, then put it in
  lowercase even at the start of a sentence. But it's better to revise
  the sentence to avoid putting a lowercase word at the start, if
  possible.

  Recommended: You can use macOS to
  run the app.

  Not recommended: macOS can run the
  app.

### Feature names

A *feature* is a distinctive attribute or capability of a product.
Features are usually described in terms of what they can do as part of a
product. In general, feature names are lowercase, although there are
exceptions.

When you write about a feature, don't capitalize it unless the name is
officially capitalized. If you're unsure, follow the precedent that's set
by other documents that describe the feature. As with products, match
the capitalization of a UI label if you're referring to one.


## Articles before product names

Don't use *the* before a product name unless you're using the name to
modify something else. *Do* use *the* before tool and API names.

If you use a product name as a modifier with an indefinite article (*a* or *an*), pay
close attention to which article precedes the product name.
