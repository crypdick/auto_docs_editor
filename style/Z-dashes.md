# Dashes  

This page explains when to use em dashes.

## Em dashes

To indicate a break in the flow of a sentence—or an interruption—use an em
dash, also known as a long dash. Don't put a space before or after it.

Don't use an en dash (the shorter dash) or a hyphen in place of an em dash.
The use of an en dash with spaces around it in place of
an em dash is gradually becoming more common, but it's still not very widespread
in the US in professional publishing; so far (as of early 2016), it's mostly
used in Canada and a few other places. For now, only use the em dash.

## En dashes

Don't use. Instead, use a hyphen or the word *to*.

## Colons instead of dashes in description lists

Another common but nonstandard construction is to use an em dash, an en dash, or a hyphen
surrounded by spaces to separate an item and its description. Instead, use
[a colon or a period](/style/lists#description-lists-that-use-run-in-headings).
For a series of items, use
[an HTML description list](/style/lists#description-lists) (`<dl>`).
