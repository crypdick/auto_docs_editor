# Lists

## Types of lists

* **Numbered list:** For sequential steps or priorities.
* **Bulleted list:** For non-sequential items or options.
* **Description list:** For terms and definitions.
* **Run-in headings:** Bulleted list where each item starts with a bold term and a colon (e.g., **Term**: Description).

## Syntax and Formatting

* **Parallelism:** Keep list items parallel in structure (e.g., all start with verbs).
* **Introduction:** Introduce lists with a complete sentence ending in a colon. Avoid partial sentences that flow into the list items.
* **Multi-paragraph items:** Use paragraph tags (p) for items with multiple paragraphs.

## Capitalization and Punctuation

* **Capitalization:** Start all list items with a capital letter.
* **End Punctuation:**
  * **Use a period** if the item is a complete sentence, contains a verb, or is a run-in heading with a sentence description.
  * **No period** if the item is a single word, short phrase without a verb, or code-only.

## Comma-separated lists

* Use serial commas (Oxford comma).
* **Non-exhaustive lists:** Introduce with "including" or "such as" to indicate the list is incomplete, rather than using "etc." or "and so on".
