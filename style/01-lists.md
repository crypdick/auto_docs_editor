# Lists

## Types of lists

* **Numbered list:** For sequential steps, priorities, or items where order matters.
* **Bulleted list:** For non-sequential items or options.
* **Description list:** For terms and definitions.
* **Run-in headings:** A bulleted list where each item starts with a bold term and a colon (e.g., **Term**: Description).

## Syntax and Formatting

* **Parallelism:** Keep list items parallel in structure (e.g., all start with verbs, or all are noun phrases).
* **Introduction:** Introduce lists with a complete sentence ending in a colon. Avoid partial sentences that flow into the list items.
* **Multi-paragraph items:** Use paragraph tags (p) for items with multiple paragraphs.
* **Unusual numbering:** If you need to reverse numbering or manually set values (e.g. starting at 0), use the appropriate HTML attributes (`reversed`, `value`).

## Capitalization and Punctuation

* **Capitalization:** Start all list items with a capital letter.
* **End Punctuation:**
  * **Use a period** if the item is a complete sentence, contains a verb, or is a run-in heading with a sentence description.
  * **No period** if the item is a single word, short phrase without a verb, or code-only.

## Comma-separated lists

* Use serial commas (Oxford comma) before the conjunction in a list of three or more items.
* **Non-exhaustive lists:** Introduce the list in a way that makes it clear that the list isn't all-inclusive (e.g., using "including" or "such as"). Avoid ending a list with "etc." or "and so on".
