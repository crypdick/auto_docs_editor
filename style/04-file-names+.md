# Filenames and file types

**Important:** Do not apply these naming rules to existing links or URLs (this will break them).

## Guidelines for names

* **Format:** Use lowercase with hyphens (`query-data.html`).
  * **Why?** Search engines interpret hyphens as spaces (good for SEO). Underscores are often treated as joining characters.
* **Consistency Exception:** If a directory already uses underscores (e.g. `lesson_1.md`), match the existing pattern (`lesson_2.md`) rather than mixing styles.
* **Characters:** Use only ASCII alphanumeric characters.
* **Clarity:** Avoid generic names (`document1.html`).

## Referencing

* **Files:** Use code font and add "file" (e.g., "the `build.sh` file").
* **Types:** Use formal names (PNG file), not extensions (`.png` file), unless discussing the extension itself.
* **Verbs:** Do not use file types as verbs (e.g., "Extract the zip file", not "Unzip").
