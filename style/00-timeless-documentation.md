# Timeless documentation

Avoid words that anchor documentation to a specific time or assume knowledge of past/future versions. Document the product as it exists now.

**Avoid these words in product docs:**

* *currently*, *now*, *at present*, *as of this writing* (implied by the doc's existence).
* *new*, *newer*, *latest* (quickly becomes outdated; use version numbers if needed).
* *soon*, *eventually*, *future* (don't promise features).

**Exceptions:**

* **Release notes/Blogs:** Can use *new*, *currently*.
* **Installation:** "Install the *latest* version" is acceptable.
* **Procedural timing:** "The VM restarts *soon* after..." is acceptable.
