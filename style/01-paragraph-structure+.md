# Paragraph structure

*   **Focus:** Each paragraph should address a single idea in the fewest words possible.
*   **Length:** Paragraphs often work best when they are shorter (e.g., fewer than 6 sentences), but do not break up a single idea just to meet a length heuristic. A long paragraph is acceptable if it covers only one complex idea.
*   **Critical info first:** Put the most important information at the beginning of the paragraph.
*   **Formatting:** Don't force line breaks (hard returns) within sentences.
