# Code documentation

## Code samples

* **Formatting:** Wrap lines at 80 characters.
* **Omissions:** Use comments (e.g., `# Code omitted`) instead of ellipses (`...`).
* **Introductions:** Precede with an introductory sentence/paragraph.
  * End with a **colon** if the sample follows immediately.
  * End with a **period** if there is text between (e.g., a note) or if the sentence isn't a direct lead-in.
* **Markdown:** Ensure multiline code blocks are surrounded by triple backticks.
* **Copyable:** Ensure samples are valid and copyable (unless they contain omissions/placeholders that break syntax).

## Verb forms in reference documentation

For API/reference documentation descriptions:

* **Use third-person singular:** Describes what the method does (*Creates*, *Lists*, *Gets*).
* **Avoid imperative:** Do not use *Create*, *List*, *Get*.

## Format examples

* **Introduction:** End introductory sentence with a colon if the example follows immediately.
* **Inline:**
  * Use "for example" or "such as".
  * Use parentheses if the example is short and in the middle of a sentence.
* **Punctuation:** Use a comma or em dash before an example at the end of a sentence.
