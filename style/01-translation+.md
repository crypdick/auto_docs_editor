# Write for a global audience

Write to be easily understood by non-native speakers and machine translation.

## Best practices
*   **Short sentences:** Easier to translate and understand.
*   **Simple vocabulary:** Use *start* instead of *commence*, *use* instead of *leverage*.
*   **Avoid phrasal verbs:** Use *use* instead of *make use of*.
*   **Active voice:** "System processes data" (clear subject).
*   **No directional language:** Avoid *above* or *below* (layout may change).
*   **Explicit helper words:** Use *that*, *of*, *then* to clarify relationships (e.g., "The rule *that* you defined").
*   **Avoid noun trains:** Don't stack >2 nouns as modifiers ("Hybrid cloud-native DevSecOps pipeline").
*   **Consistency:** Use the exact same term for the same concept every time.
*   **Inclusivity:** Avoid idioms (*ballpark*, *back burner*) and culturally specific references (seasons, holidays).
