# Write for a global audience

Write to be easily understood by non-native speakers and machine translation.

## Best practices

* **Short sentences:** Easier to translate and understand.
* **Simple vocabulary:** Use *start* instead of *commence*, *use* instead of *leverage*.
* **Avoid phrasal verbs:** Use *use* instead of *make use of*.
* **Active voice:** "System processes data" (clear subject).
* **No directional language:** Avoid *above* or *below* (layout may change).
* **Explicit helper words:** Use *that*, *of*, *then* to clarify relationships (e.g., "The rule *that* you defined").
* **Clarify antecedents:** If a pronoun (*it*, *they*) is ambiguous, replace it with the noun.
  * *Ambiguous:* "If you use the term in an ad, make sure **it** is targeted."
  * *Clear:* "If you use the term in an ad, make sure **the ad** is targeted."
* **Modifier placement:** Place modifiers like *only* immediately before the word they modify.
  * *Correct:* "Request *only* one token."
  * *Incorrect:* "*Only* request one token."
* **Avoid noun trains:** Don't stack >2 nouns as modifiers ("Hybrid cloud-native DevSecOps pipeline").
* **Repetition:** Repeat a word if it improves clarity.
  * *Better:* "IAM segmentation and network segmentation."
  * *Worse:* "IAM and network segmentation."
* **Consistency:** Use the exact same term for the same concept every time.
* **Inclusivity:** Avoid idioms (*ballpark*, *back burner*) and culturally specific references (seasons, holidays).
