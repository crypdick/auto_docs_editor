# Abbreviations

Use standard abbreviations to save time, but spell them out if they might be unfamiliar. If the reader has to pause to decipher an abbreviation, it slows down comprehension.

## Guidelines

* **First reference:** Spell out the term followed by the abbreviation in parentheses: *Border Gateway Protocol* (*BGP*).
* **Exceptions:** Don't spell out widely known terms (AI, API, URL, PDF, JSON, USB).
* **Plurals:** Add *s* or *es* (APIs, OSes). Do not use an apostrophe.
* **Verbs:** Do not use abbreviations as verbs (e.g., "Use SSH to log in", not "ssh into").
* **Latin abbreviations:** Avoid *i.e.* and *e.g.*. Use *that is* and *for example* respectively.
* **Periods:**
  * **No periods** for acronyms/initialisms (US, UK, API).
  * **Use periods** for shortened words (Dr., etc.).

## Indefinite articles

Choose *a* or *an* based on the pronunciation of the abbreviation.

* "an API" (pronounced "ay-pee-eye" - starts with vowel sound).
* "a URL" (pronounced "yu-are-el" - starts with consonant sound).
