# Anthropomorphism

Don't attribute human qualities (seeing, telling, thinking, wanting) to software or hardware.

**Why?** Anthropomorphism is figurative language, which is imprecise and difficult to translate.

* **Recommended:** "The system detects a new device." / "The object specifies the split point."
* **Not recommended:** "The system sees a new device." / "The object tells the splitter..."
