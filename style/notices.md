# Notices

*   **Types:**
    *   **Note:** Useful but not critical info.
    *   **Caution:** Proceed carefully (potential minor issue).
    *   **Warning:** Critical (data loss, security risk).
    *   **Success:** Valid confirmation (interactive only).
*   **Usage:** Don't use notices for prerequisites or procedural steps. Avoid stacking notices.

Use notices for important or useful information that does not flow naturally into the main text. Assume that the reader will
skip the notice, so do not include critical information in a notice. Do not use too many notices. Avoid grouping two or more notices together.
