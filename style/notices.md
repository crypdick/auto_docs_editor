# Notices

Use notices sparingly. Readers often skip them.

## Types of notices

* **Note:** Helpful information that is not critical.
* **Caution:** Advises the reader to act carefully to avoid a minor issue or annoyance.
* **Warning:** Critical information about risks of data loss, security breaches, or irreversible acts. Means "Don't do this."
* **Success:** Confirms a successful action (use only in interactive UIs).

## When NOT to use a notice

* **Prerequisites:** Put these in the main text before the procedure.
* **Procedural steps:** Do not hide steps inside notes.
* **Cross-references:** Use standard links, not notes.
* **Expected results:** Describe these in the main text.

## Guidelines

* **Don't stack notices:** Avoid putting two notices in a row. Reorganize content instead.
* **Don't overuse:** Too many notices cause "banner blindness."
