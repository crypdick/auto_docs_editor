# Excessive claims

* **Avoid hype:** Don't use *best*, *fastest*, *guaranteed* unless verifiable.
* **Future-proof:** Ensure claims will remain true over time. Avoid absolute statements that might be invalidated by future releases or competitor updates.
* **Security:** Don't claim a product is "secure" (implies invulnerability). Say it "helps with security" or "is designed for security".
* **Comparisons:** Be factual, specific, and cite sources.
