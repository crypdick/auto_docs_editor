# Excessive claims

*   **Avoid hype:** Don't use *best*, *fastest*, *guaranteed* unless verifiable.
*   **Security:** Don't claim a product is "secure" (implies invulnerability). Say it "helps with security" or "is designed for security".
*   **Comparisons:** Be factual, specific, and cite sources.
