# Italics for terms

Use italics in two specific cases:

1. **New terms:** Italicize a new technical term upon its first definition (e.g., "A *Clos network* is a kind of...").
2. **Words as words:** Italicize when referring to a word or letter itself (e.g., "Use the word *and*").

**Note:**

* Do not use bold or quotation marks for these cases.
* This style does **not** apply to code elements (use code font) or product names (use standard capitalization).
