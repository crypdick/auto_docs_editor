**Note**: This document includes references to terms that Google considers
disrespectful or offensive. The terms are listed here to provide usage
guidance and alternative terms.

This word list covers style and usage guidelines that are specific to developer documentation.

If the term that you're looking for isn't on this list, check our other
[editorial resources](/style#editorial-resources), including our preferred
dictionary,
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). If there are multiple spellings in
the Merriam-Webster word entry, use the first form listed, which is the most common spelling. For
example, in the
[entry for *cancel*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/canceled),
the first form listed for the past tense is *canceled*, indicating that it's more common than
*cancelled*.

If you're looking for a technical definition, then it's often a good idea to check the
authoritative documentation on the topic.

Terminology decisions, including how and when to define or contextualize
terms, often require judgments based on factors like your product area,
your audience, and prevailing convention. Here are some other pages of this
guide that can help you make those types of judgments:

* [Jargon](/style/jargon)
* [Inclusive language](/style/inclusive-documentation)
* [Write for a global audience](/style/translation)
* [Hyphens](/style/hyphens)
* [Capitalization](/style/capitalization)

As always, it's fine to deviate from our guidance if that serves your readers
better. For more information, see [Break the rules](/style#rules).

## Word list

All word list entries have a link link
icon next to them. To link directly to an entry, you can right-click and
copy the link address, or click and copy the URL from your address bar.

Some word list entries include guidance to *avoid* or *don't use* a
term. Apply this guidance as follows:

* **Use with caution**. A recommendation to avoid using the term *when
  possible*, or to use the term with caution. The term might be ambiguous
  or obscure, so we provide alternative term suggestions or suggest that you
  use a more specific term. However, you can use the term if needed. Where
  appropriate, define the term or use it only once, as explained on the
  [Jargon](/style/jargon) page.
* **Don't use**. In all cases, we prefer to *not use the term*. The
  term might be particularly ambiguous or it might have an offensive or
  non-inclusive association. If such a term appears in code, we recommend that
  you
  [replace or write around the term](/style/inclusive-documentation#replace-or-write-around-non-inclusive-terms).
* **Android**. Applies only to Android documentation.
* **Google Cloud**. Applies only to Google Cloud documentation.
* **Google Workspace**. Applies only to Google Workspace documentation.

    * For the noun *whitelist*, consider using a replacement such as

    * For the noun *graylist* (*greylist*), consider using a
      replacement such as *provisional list*.
:   In all of these cases, consider that there might not actually be a list
    involved. When replacing problematic terms, be sure to be technically
    accurate for the specific context.
:   For the verb forms of these words, a simple word-for-word replacement
    typically isn't the best solution. Instead, replace verbs such as
    *blacklisted* with phrases that accurately convey the relevant
    action. For example:
:   Recommended: To deny requests from
    an IP address, add it to the `dos.yaml` file.

    address, add it to the `dos.yaml` file.

    ([formatted as code](/style/code-in-text)), and make it clear
    what you're referring to.

      *preplanned procedure*.

            the `Control` key, and there's an `Option` key instead
            of an `Alt` key. If your audience includes macOS users and

    understood, if you use the term, make sure to define it on first use.:   :   Don't use *down scope* or *down-scope*
        :   Recommended: Reducing the scope of a
            token helps you follow the principle of least privilege.

            *qualitative variable*.

:   In procedures, use the appropriate label and action for the
    [UI element](/style/ui-elements) that the user interacts with. When describing a
    user action or the state of a UI element, use a more precise term where possible. It's OK to
    use *enable* when not referring to a person.
:   For turning on or activating an option or feature, use *enable* or
    *[turn on](#turn-on)* consistently:

    describe testing.

    For more information, see

happiness and satisfaction [link](#happiness)
:   Use *happiness* when referring to a customer's perception of a
    site's reliability. Use *satisfaction* when referring to whether the
    site meets the customer's needs.
:   Site reliability engineering (SRE) content generally refers to
    measuring *customer happiness* instead of *customer
    satisfaction*. The two phrases are not equivalent.
:   The distinction the SRE documentation makes is between satisfying a need
    (a dispassionate act) and establishing an emotional response (creating
    happiness). Although it is difficult to measure happiness precisely, SRE
    uses [service level indicators
    (SLIs)](#service-level-indicator) to quantify user perception. For example, a customer might feel
    a "need" to watch a show on TV. If the show is available, the customer's
    need is satisfied. But if playback is slow or choppy, the customer might
    not be happy.
:   For more information about SRE and measuring reliability, see [The Happiness Test](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/site-reliability-engineering-slos/the-happiness-test-ELmSr).

    term refers to health in the medical sense.
:   Use detailed, non-figurative language as much as possible, such as
    referring to a node *being responsive* instead of referring to a node
    being healthy.

healthy [link](#healthy)
:   Don't use. See [health check](#health-check).

:   In Android documentation, use
    *higher* for a range of version numbers, not *later*.
:   A release with the highest version number might not be the latest version.
    For example, if version 2.0 of an operating system receives a bug-fix
    update after version 3.0 has been released, then version 2.0.1 might be
    the latest version, even though its version number is lower than 3.0.

      react—for example, waiting for a tooltip to open or waiting for a
      submenu to open.
    * When the duration of time is important.

    The phrase *point to* is more common.
:   See also [point to](#point-to).

    menu, hold the pointer over **File**, and then click **New**.

    [hotspot](#hotspot).

hotspot[link](#hotspot)
:   In databases, *hotspots* occur when a small number of nearby rows are
    accessed frequently in a short period of time, causing CPU spikes and
    affecting performance. Use *hotspot* and *hotspots* as nouns.
    Don't use verb and gerund forms such as *hotspotting*, because they
    translate less consistently.
:   When you use *hotspot*, define it the first time that you use it on
    a page as you normally do with jargon.
:   Recommended: Hotspots in one table
    can affect the performance of other tables.
:   Not recommended: Hotspotting in one
    table can affect the performance of other tables.

    example, a version number or release date.
:   Don't use *newer* to refer to a specific version of a product.

    best to use a more specific term, such as *usage limit*; the word

    *quota*, so use that term.

    eliminating this word from the sentence because usually the same meaning

since [link](#since)

    *since*. *Since* is ambiguous; it can refer to the passage of
    time. *Because* refers to causation or the reason for something.

single most [link](#single-most)
:   Not *singlemost*.

single pane of glass [link](#single-pane-of-glass)
:   Avoid. This term is used to favorably compare a centralized control and

    you're referring to, and use the new term thereafter. For example, "Invoke
    the secondary (`slave`) process directly when debugging issues
    between the primary and secondary processes."
:   See also [master](#master).

slice and dice [link](#slice)

    target [link](#target)
    :   Avoid using as a verb when possible, especially in reference to people.

        their lives easier.
    :   It's OK to use *target* as an adjective, as in *target
        audience*, but consider rephrasing for clarity. Alternatives
        include phrases such as *intended for*, *looking for*,
        *focused on*, and *interacting with*.

        command-line syntax](/style/code-syntax#linux-signals).:   :   In some contexts, such as telephony and networking, *terminate* has
                specific technical meanings that aren't synonyms for *stop*; in those

            text box, textbox [link](#textbox)
            :   Don't use. Instead, use *box*. For more information, see

            :   Where possible, put a noun after *this* or *that* for clarity.
                If doing so results in clunky prose, then don't do it; but even then, try
                thinking about what the noun would be. If you aren't sure what noun
                *this* or *that* refers to, then consider rephrasing—
                otherwise, your reader probably won't know what noun you're referring to,
                either.

            timeframe [link](#time-frame)
            :   Not *time frame*. Avoid where possible, or use an alternative such as
