# Paragraph structure

*   **Focus:** Each paragraph should address a single idea in the fewest words possible (usually < 6 sentences).
*   **Length:** Break long paragraphs into smaller ones, but don't break up a single idea just for length.
*   **Critical info first:** Put the most important information at the beginning of the paragraph.
*   **Formatting:** Don't force line breaks (hard returns) within sentences.
